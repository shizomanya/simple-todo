## About

**To Do List** is a minimalistic task-management web application built entirely with vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to create tasks, search through them, mark them as completed, delete individual tasks, or clear the entire list. All data is stored in **localStorage**, ensuring tasks persist after page reload. The goal of this project is to demonstrate clean architecture, structured JavaScript logic, and BEM-oriented styling without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

---

## Features

- LocalStorage persistence — tasks remain saved after refreshing the page  
- Real-time task search with dynamic filtering  
- Smooth item appearance/disappearance animations  
- Delete individual tasks or remove all tasks at once  
- BEM-based CSS structure for clean 
- Fully responsive layout  
- Semantic HTML and accessible controls  
- UI messages based on state: *There are no tasks yet*, *Tasks not found*  
- Zero dependencies — fully handcrafted logic and design

---

## Technologies

- **HTML5** — semantic and structured markup  
- **CSS3 (BEM)** — organized, maintainable, block-based styling  
- **normalize.css** — cross-browser base consistency  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** — classes, modules, event handling, localStorage API
